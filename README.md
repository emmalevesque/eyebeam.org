## Hello, friends

This is the GitHub repo for [eyebeam.org](https://eyebeam.org/), whose motto is
Technology by Artists. If you want to help us improve the site, please don't
hesitate to [file new issues](https://github.com/eyebeam/eyebeam.org/issues/)
or get in touch at [info@eyebeam.org](mailto:info@eyebeam.org).

## Statements of bias

The website is a work in progress and inevitably things will go wrong. We should
endeavor to deploy working fixes as quickly as possible. We should not go about
building a perfect, timeless cathedral. Useful mottos include "better than
yesterday" and "build the simplest, dumbest thing first," and "optimize for
speed-of-deployment."

## Credits

from scratch by [@dphiffer](https://github.com/dphiffer) and designed by

Also thanks to [@straup](https://github.com/straup) for teaching me the biases
described above.
