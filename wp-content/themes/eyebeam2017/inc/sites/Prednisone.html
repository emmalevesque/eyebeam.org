What is Prednisone? (Sildenafil citrate) <br>

Prednisone is a corticosteroid  used to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms in a variety of disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis and severe cases of asthma. Prednisone decreases or prevents tissues from responding to inflammation and also modifies the body's response to certain immune stimulation.<br /><br /> <strong>Dosage and direction<br /></strong><br /> Take it orally with or without food (it's recommended that prednisone be taken with food). <br /> Commonly used dosage is various from 5 to 60 mg per day and often is adjusted based on the response of the condition being treated. Corticosteroids should be used for several days for best result. Prolonged therapy with this drug causes the adrenal glands to atrophy and stop producing cortisol, so when Prednisone is discontinued after a period of prolonged therapy, the dose of Prednisone must be tapered to allow the adrenal glands time to recover.<br /> <strong>Note:</strong> this instruction presented here just for review. It's very necessary to consult your doctor before using. It will help you to get the best results. <br /><br /> <strong>Precautions<br /></strong><br /> You should not start taking Prednisone if you are suffering from a severe bacterial, fungal or viral infection.

Do not stop taking Prednisone suddenly because your own adrenal glands cannot quickly produce enough cortisone. Also note that this drug increases appetite! So you must control your meal. Use caution in children because Prednisone can affect growth. Prednisone should not be used during pregnancy, becoming pregnant or lactating without doctor's advice. Do not use before breast-feeding without doctor's advice.<br /><br /> <strong>Contraindications<br /></strong><br /> Prednisone is not allowed to people who are hypersensitive to any components of this medicine.
