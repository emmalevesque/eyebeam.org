Hello world,

Thanks for viewing source, I appreciate that you care how this works. It's me,
@dphiffer here, writing my first Secret Blog Post. You can only read this if you
view source, it does not otherwise exist in the realm of visible hypertext.

The idea for this blog is to help you understand how this site is built, what
it's made out of. The stuff you see here in the HTML source code doesn't include
the range of stuff that constitutes a modern web page; back-end code, minified
assets, AJAX requests.

These posts are meant to help you understand how it all works. Maybe you'll even
decide to pitch in and contribute your own fixes! I'm happy to review your pull
requests on GitHub or look into any issues you might find as an end user.

All of that happens on this GitHub repo: https://github.com/eyebeam/eyebeam.org

My belief is that running code is only part of the story. By code I mean the
instructions encoded into a text file, written by a human. It is, in effect,
an original text intended to be read (by a machine) in translation.

Here's a thought experiment. Let's think of code as if it were a work of poetry.
It's like writing a poem in English, and then mailing it to your translator
friend who produces a Hungarian equivalent. The web server, and your browser,
are each doing a version of that every time you load up a web page.

The upshot is that things go wrong. Phrases that make sense to you, the human
programmer, may get lost in translation when the computer attempts to turn it
into its own understood grammar. This is called "incorrect" code. It includes
both syntax errors (things that make zero sense to the computer) and also
things that execute the wrong way.

All of this is to say coding is prone to bugs. All Code Has Bugs is a motto of
mine, and so you have to be ready to make adjustments along the way. This
website is a work in progress, it will require maintenance in response to new
software updates and instances where the code is Incorrect.

There are also a bunch of missing features, but we'll start with bug fixes.
We just launched this new version of the site ~today~ so the first priority will
be to fix the bugs. If you find something is wrong, please send along a
description of what you're seeing! Bonus points if you include a URL and/or a
screenshot of the behavior.

Okay that is all, back to bug fixing for me. If you check back here later, I'll
add a link to the next post right here:
