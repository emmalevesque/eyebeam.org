Hello friend,

You have made it to the second post! I wrote this one on the Archive page
in part because it is easy to overlook it (there's no Archive nav item) and also
just because I love archives. Over time there should be more items archived on
this page, so check back in here later!

This second blog post is here to encourage you to try running a development
version of the website yourself. Having a running dev version of the site is an
essential precursor to making any changes to the live website.

I've automated some of the setup process, but you will need to install some
stuff and use your computer's terminal. If the terminal is unfamiliar to you,
don't panic, the steps described here should help you build up your confidence.

Before we begin, there are three things you'll need to install:

1. git. If you're on a Mac, you can just install the Xcode mega-package from the
   App Store (found under the Apple menu), and that will take care of git.
   Otherwise, take a look at https://git-scm.com/ for install instructions.
2. VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
3. Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

Aside from the space used by these tools, you will also need some free disk
space for the virtual machine itself. I measured my disk usage before and after
setting up my VM (virtual machine) and it looks like you'll need at least 2GB
of spare disk space.

Ready? Let's do this. Before we start, you should decide on a place you want
to store all the eyebeam.org files. I put mine in my Sites folder, but the files
can live wherever you prefer, it doesn't really matter. I'll assume the Sites
folder in these instructions, but feel free to adjust according to your own
preferences.

0. Open the terminal (on a Mac it's in Applications/Utilities).

1. Clone the eyebeam.org repo:

    cd ~/Sites
    git clone https://github.com/eyebeam/eyebeam.org.git

You should end up with a folder ~/Sites/eyebeam.org. We're going to do most of
our setup work inside the 'develop' subfolder.

2. Bring up the virtual machine:

    cd eyebeam.org/develop
    vagrant up

You will see a bunch of Linux setup text scroll by. In film and TV, this is the
kind of thing they show when a character is doing "hacker things." You should
see a box that summarizes our next steps:

    +--------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                                        |
    |   Congrats, you now have a Linux virtual machine       |
    |   running. You're almost done!                         |
    |                                                        |
    |   Next steps:                                          |
    |       sudo ./setup_host.sh                             |
    |       vagrant ssh                                      |
    |       cd eyebeam.org/develop                           |
    |       sudo ./setup_vagrant.sh                          |
    |                                                        |
    +--------------------------------------------------------+

Before you launch into that, let's take stock of what we have going right now.
You are running a Linux virtual machine on your computer using VirtualBox
and Vagrant. (The latter automates the former.) The machine is running Ubuntu
14.04 (which is what the eyebeam.org server runs) and has been updated
with software updates, but nothing has been installed yet.

One last detail: the eyebeam.org folder is shared between your host machine and
the VM, meaning any changes you make in one will appear in the other. It's kind
of like a network share. Inside the VM, its file permissions are set so that
everything is owned by Apache's user, www-data, in case you have trouble editing
files within the VM.

3. Setup your /etc/hosts file

    sudo ./setup_host.sh

This will add an entry in your /etc/hosts file to trick your computer into
thinking the website dev.eyebeam.org lives at the VM's IP address,
192.168.33.10.

4. Login to the VM

    vagrant ssh

In the hacker movie, this is when the character says "....I'm in" to dramatic
effect. It's a little weird, you are using your "host" computer terminal to
log into the "guest" computer via SSH. Technically it's using localhost port
2222, which could be helpful info if you want to do SSH tunneling with a tool
like Sequel Pro (we'll get to that in a later post).

The point is that when you type commands now, they are handled by Ubuntu, not
macOS. Weird right? But also very useful! We can use all the Linux tools that
are common to the live server, which means we can avoid platform-specific
differences between your dev environment and the live server.

5. Look around

    ls -l
    df

Before we continue, take a look around the VM to see where things live. The
`ls -l` command will show you that we have a convenient symlink to
/var/www/eyebeam.org in the home directory. As mentioned before, this is a
shared folder with the host machine, and the `df` command should show it mounted
into Ubuntu as its own file system. Kind of like a network mounted drive.

6. Run the Vagrant setup script

    cd eyebeam.org/develop
    sudo ./setup_vagrant.sh

A bunch of things will happen next, and they may take some time to complete.
You might want to leave your computer running for a while and check back in on
it later. Here's a run-down of what the script is doing:

1. Install Apache, MySQL, and PHP
2. Download and unpack https://wordpress.org/latest.zip
3. Configure wp-config.php
4. Download and restore a nightly database backup
5. Download and unpack all the 'wp-content/uploads' files

This last step may prompt you about whether you want to overwrite a specific
file that already exists. I ~think~ this has to do with case-sensitive vs.
case-insensitive file systems, and I just chose capital-A for "overwrite all."
I still need to look into why it has two copies of some files, but I think it's
that there are two versions with different capitalizations (which is allowed in
Linux, and not on most Mac file systems).

7. Try it out

When the dust settles, you should see another box that describes what to do
next:

    +--------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                                        |
    |   All done!                                            |
    |                                                        |
    |   - Load up http://dev.eyebeam.org/ in a browser       |
    |   - Dashboard: http://dev.eyebeam.org/wp-admin/        |
    |   - Username: eyebeam                                  |
    |     Password: techbyartists                            |
    |                                                        |
    +--------------------------------------------------------+

One caveat: there is a specific configuration in wp-config.php that we *should*
have enabled: define('WP_DEBUG', true);

But we didn't, on purpose. The reason for this has to do with a plugin we use
called Advanced Custom Fields, and the full explanation warrants its own
separate blog post. So for now we will just leave WP_DEBUG turned off and try
out the dev version of the site, running on our own local VM.

Check back here later for a link to the *next* blog post! And please don't
hesitate to get in touch if you run into any problems during the setup process.
